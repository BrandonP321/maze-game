# The Maze Game
This is a maze game with 3 difficulties: easy, medium, and hard.  While this might seem like just another simple maze game, what makes it more than average is that the maze itself is prodeurally generated on page load.  This allows the program to be very lightweight since it isn't storing all the different mazes.

## Motivation
I was looking for another project that would challenge me in a way that was different from the projects I have worked on in the past.  I very much enjoy building small browser games but I've yet to build anything that was procedurally generated.
